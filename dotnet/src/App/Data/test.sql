This improves their performance, fault tolerance, and reliability. However, it also introduces added complexity.</p>\r\n<p>This paradigm shift changes the application distribution on physical servers from 1-to-1 to many-to-1. In addition, these Docker containers are ephemeral: they may only run for a short time and relocate as well.

It can also be deployed as a singleton Docker container per host, as well as a package. CoScale only deploys a single agent per host to minimize the impact on application performance. It supports all modern operating systems including Ubuntu, CentOS, RedHat, Windows Server and Debian. CoScale supports dozens of applications out of the box, with simple scripts to create and send custom metrics. In addition, it has <strong>no external dependencies</strong>.</p>\r\n<h2>Full Stack Performance Monitoring</h2>\r\n<p>As soon as CoScale receives metrics data, it will automatically create dashboards for every application being monitored, in addition to a few high-level views of your system. These dashboards are fully customizable and let you go from high-level views all the way down to introspecting specific servers, containers, and applications. A common use case is to create a high-level dashboard showing the overall health of your distributed microservice cluster, with “click through” widgets allowing you to further introspect into your environment.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://boxboat.com/partnerships/coscale/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1700\" src=\"https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/coscale-high-1024x431.jpg\" alt=\"coscale full stack performance monitoring dashboard\" width=\"1024\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/coscale-high-1024x431.jpg 1024w, https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/coscale-high-300x126.jpg 300w, https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/coscale-high-768x324.jpg 768w, https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/coscale-high-610x257.jpg 610w, https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/coscale-high-1080x455.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></p>\r\n<p>In addition, CoScale uses powerful algorithms to&nbsp;<strong>automatically calculate anomalies</strong>. Regardless of the metric, CoScale will identify any anomalies and then alert your system administrator to help keep your applications and infrastructure healthy. CoScale also ships with an alerting system that directly integrates with e-mail, slack, or a third-party tool through the use of APIs.</p>\r\n<h2>Events For Context</h2>\r\n<p>Viewing the performance of your entire cluster is paramount to keeping your applications online. However, it is sometimes very challenging to determine the cause of performance degradation. It is easy to observe that the page load time for your web application has increased by 30%, but&nbsp;<em>why?</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>CoScale solves this problem through the use of its eventing system. CoScale automatically hooks into the events such as deployments. It will overlay these events onto your dashboards to provide context to help determine the cause of problems that affect your infrastructure.</p>\r\n<p>If the built-in eventing system isn’t enough for your organization, you can always monitor custom events to overlay onto your performance graphs and provide the context your organization requires.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.boxboat.com/partnerships/coscale\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1703\" src=\"https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/eventing-dashboard-1024x217.jpg\" alt=\"coscale docker container microservice event metrics\" width=\"1024\" height=\"217\" srcset=\"https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/eventing-dashboard-1024x217.jpg 1024w, https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/eventing-dashboard-300x64.jpg 300w, https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/eventing-dashboard-768x163.jpg 768w, https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/eventing-dashboard-610x129.jpg 610w, https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/eventing-dashboard-1080x229.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></p>\r\n<h2>The Best Container-First Microservice Monitoring Solution</h2>\r\n<p>To summarize, CoScale is the <strong>best container-first microservice monitoring solution</strong>.

(2, 2, '<p>Deploying enterprise applications is very different today than it was even a few years ago. Organizations have migrated away from large, monolithic legacy applications towards distributed microservices. This paradigm shift not only complicates orchestration and deployment, but makes securing your applications both more complex and challenging. Securing these distributed microservices is of paramount importance. Every week, there is a new article about how another company was hacked and lost sensitive data to the detriment of their bottom line.</p>\r\n<p>Docker Datacenter provides an integrated, end-to-end platform for agile application management that <strong>ships with several industry-leading security mechanisms to protect your applications and data</strong>. It&nbsp;deploys&nbsp;your Containers as a Service (CaaS) architecture on-premise or in the cloud, providing a centralized management console for ease-of-use.&nbsp;Today, it is the best stand-alone solution to secure your enterprise applications. It does this through several built-in components.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"margin: auto; display: block\" src=\"https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/docker-datacenter.png\" alt=\"secure your enterprise software with docker datacenter\" width=\"491\" height=\"294\" srcset=\"https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/docker-datacenter.png 491w, https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/docker-datacenter-300x180.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<h2>Docker Universal Control Plane</h2>\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/1.1/overview/\">Docker Universal Control Plane</a>&nbsp;(UCP)&nbsp;is the enterprise solution for cluster management. It can be installed either on-premises, or inside your cloud infrastructure. It provides a graphical interface to securely manage your entire cluster from a single location. Specifically, you can manage applications, images, containers, networks, and volumes from a single interface. In addition, it fully supports the Docker API so you can introspect your cluster using tools that you are already familiar with.</p>\r\n<p>UCP uses its own built-in authentication mechanism. In addition, it supports integration with&nbsp;<strong>LDAP</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Active Directory</strong>. This allows UCP to easily integrate into your enterprise authentication solution. UCP also supports Role based Access Controls (RBAC). This allows your organization to specify who&nbsp;the authorized users are, and what actions they are able to take.</p>\r\n<h2>Docker Secrets Management</h2>\r\n<p>When you stand up Docker Datacenter, you get&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/\">Docker Swarm</a>&nbsp;working out of the box. Docker Swarm recently introduced native <strong>secrets management</strong>, a mechanism for you to securely deploy “secrets” (e.g. credentials or certificates) to your swarm containers.</p>\r\n<p>Containers will often need to access other resources, such as a database. Since your database will have access credentials, you need to deploy those credentials to the container accessing it. You should not deploy those secrets as unencrypted strings in Docker-Compose or a Dockerfile. Deploying&nbsp;an unprotected key-value to serve sensitive information to containers is also an insecure solution.</p>\r\n<p><img  style=\"margin: auto; display: block\" src=\"https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/docker-secrets-1024x452.png\" alt=\"secure your enterprise software with docker datacenter\" width=\"1024\" height=\"452\" srcset=\"https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/docker-secrets-1024x452.png 1024w, https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/docker-secrets-300x132.png 300w, https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/docker-secrets-768x339.png 768w, https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/docker-secrets-610x269.png 610w, https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/docker-secrets-1080x477.png 1080w, https://boxboat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/docker-secrets.png 1425w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></p>\r\n<p>Docker Datacenter provides lifecycle management and deployment of secrets through the user interface. It also supports access controls. Docker Datacenter will deploy secrets to each swarm’s Internal Distributed Store via TLS. From there, manager nodes will securely deploy these secrets to any&nbsp;containers running on worker nodes at runtime.</p>\r\n<h2>Docker Trusted Registry</h2>\r\n<p>When your organization uses Docker Datacenter to manage application infrastructure, you get a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/dtr/2.2/guides/\">Docker Trusted Registry</a>&nbsp;(DTR)&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>default</strong>. This trusted registry is where your organization will store all of your Docker images used by your application and developer teams. Keeping the DTR internal and behind your firewall will&nbsp;protect it against external threats.</p>\r\n<p>DTR uses the same authentication mechanisms as UCP (default Docker authentication, LDAP, and Active Directory). It also supports RBAC so you have fine-grained control over who has access to different sets of container. From a security standpoint, this means you have a firewall protected, private registry that uses an integrated authentication mechanism which reduces the number of weak passwords that have access to your system.</p>\r\n<h2>Docker Image Security Scanning</h2>\r\n<p>One of the hardest parts of securing an application is ensuring that all of the external code dependencies you use are free of exploits. As a software engineer, I can tell you that it is&nbsp;impossible to guarantee that code lacks vulnerabilities. However, the ability to automatically detect vulnerabilities and remove them from your code base is a very powerful feature. What is even more powerful is the ability to tag and blacklist binaries so that no applications will be built using this insecure code. Docker Datacenter does this.</p>\r\n<p>DTR introduced a new feature that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/dtr/2.2/guides/admin/configure/set-up-vulnerability-scans/\">scans your dependencies</a>&nbsp;and <strong>automatically detects known malicious code</strong>. Recall that a Docker container is built on multiple “image layers,” where a single “image layer” contains software dependencies. DTR will scan each of these “image layers,” and compare the binary signatures to those in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/\">MITRE CVE database</a>. If DTR finds any “image layers” that contain code referenced in this vulnerability database, it will tag any images associated with those “image layers” as being insecure. In addition, you can write a security policy such that no Docker container can be run if they do not pass their security scan.</p>\r\n<h2>Full Stack Security</h2>\r\n<p>Docker Datacenter, when used in conjunction with secure hardware and a secure public interface, provides full stack security for your distributed, microservice-based application. The native, built-in features of Docker Datacenter provide you with the following security mechanisms:</p>\r\n<ol style=\"margin-left: 50px;\">\r\n<li>Access controls for cluster and image management</li>\r\n<li>Trusted image repository</li>\r\n<li>Secure secrets management through TLS</li>\r\n<li>Automated image CVE detection</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Every organization must protect their vital data and applications. Although no solution will completely protect you, Docker Datacenter’s built-in, default software and configuration will&nbsp;provide superior security to protect your applications.</p>', 'Secure Your Enterprise Software With Docker Datacenter'),
